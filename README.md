# My Personal "Awesome" Go List

ðŸŽ‰ Just learning Go? Never coded before? Welcome to the party! Here's what I recommend most people do to learn it well.

 1.  [Tour of Go][1] (no setup, get coding, okay not to finish)
 2.  [How to Write Go Code][3]
 3.  [Effective go][4] (to understand why)
 4.  Start reading [Go 101][8] concurrently (600 pages) and [Go Modules][10] (not in book)
 5.  Code something with concurrency (net/http, contexts)
 6.  Read [Go Code Review Comments][7] for style guide
 7.  [The Go Programming Language Specification][5] to fill any gap
 8.  Read and learn from the [Go standard library][6] source code
 9.  Maybe read [Learning Go][9] (but you'll have to buy it)
 10. Start a personal [Bonzaiâ„¢ command tree][2] to play around with tools

ðŸ’¥ It is really important you get coding something you *want* to make, a project, as soon as possible. That will keep you motivated to learn. Obviously, you'll be writing a lot of your own code between reading books. But, by the time you read all of that, while coding at the same time, you'll be on your way to becoming a Go master for sure.

And ...

> "Oh really, Jessie, does it inspire awe?" (Jane, Breaking Bad)

I'm not a fan of most "awesome" lists. Most of them are full of crap and
many are more about promoting that crap than anything else. My list has
three purposes:

1. Promote my own crap and keep track of it
2. Easily find awe-inspiring Go 1.18+ code and content
3. Help people get started with Go programming

Disclosure: I actually sponsor some of these with my own cash. They are
really that good.

## No-Cost, Non-Restrictive

Everything here is either Apache, BSD, or MIT licensed. I don't do GPLv3
and personally share Linus Torvalds opinion that it destroyed the FSF.

I also won't list anything here that has a paywall of any kind,
including books you have to purchase without a free version. Not
everyone in the world can find the money to pay American prices for
things. Holding knowledge behind a paywall that is based on the economy
of your particularly affluent country is unethical. I won't do it.
People can pay what they can for content I produce. That decision is up
to them, not the randomness of the conditions in which a person is born.

## My Own Stuff

* ðŸŒ³ **Go Bonzaiâ„¢ Composite Commander**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai>

  A truly unique commander with recursive tab completion; no exported
  shell code required for completion; command aliases; multicall or
  monolith mode; rich embedded command documentation with markdown and
  templating; library of completers (files, dates, calculator);
  localized, modular configuration management; persisted variables to
  user local cache

* ðŸŒ³ **Go Bonzaiâ„¢ Composite Command Example**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai-example>

  A GitHub template you can copy and get started with creating your own
  monoliths and multicall binaries composed of your favorite Bonzai
  branches

* ðŸŒ³ **Personal Bonzai Command Tree Monolith**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/z>

  My own meticulously manicured monolith (my `z` command) that I use
  hundreds of times a day. It's becoming almost like a BusyBox Linux
  distro as more branches are added to it. Everything I write now is a
  Bonzai branch with a standalone, a high-level function library, and a
  composable branch Cmd. I can easily copy my `z` to *any* system so I
  have all my favorite "scripts" --- including bundled configurations
  for `vim`, `tmux`, `lynx` and such
  ([dot](https://github.com/rwxrob/dot)). By 2023, I hope to be 100%
  script free. 

* ðŸŒ³ **Help Docs with Templates, Like `man` Pages**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/help>

  Bundle your documentation with your Bonzai branch or tree with
  `help.Cmd`; supports BonzaiMark, CommonMark templates
  (`text/template`) with full set of common template functions; like
  Hugo for terminal apps. Includes pager detection with color support.

* ðŸŒ³ **Persist Variables to Portable Local Cache**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/vars>

  Better than environment variables; add scoped, persistent variables to
  any of your Bonzai branch or tree; .key=value properties value form
  for fastest-possible parsing (way faster than YAML/JSON; single file;
  standard user cache location; includes high-level `pkg` for use
  without `bonzai`

* ðŸŒ³ **Local Configuration Management with YAML/JSON**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/conf>

  Built on the highly popular and performant yaml.v3 and
  [yqlib](https://github.com/rwxrob/yq); add persistent, manageable
  configuration to any Bonzai branch or tree; single file; edit with
  preferred local editor; includes high-level `pkg` for use without
  `bonzai`

* ðŸŒ³ **Common Web Requests**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/web>

  Drop-dead simple web requests with a strong high-level function `pkg`
  as well; never miss `curl` again; (eventually, planned to take the
  place of `lynx` for terminal based web browsing as well, built with
  `tview`)

* ðŸŒ³ **GitHub Common Tasks (API)**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/github>

  Just a collection of my personal favorite and most needed GitHub API queries
  and `gh` wrappers. Most people will want to use the amazing [gh GitHub
  CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) instead (which can be extended for most
  things, just not these). Includes `latest` and release pushing, and more.

* ðŸŒ³ **KEG, Knowledge Exchange Graph PKG Utility**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/keg>

  Rethinking knowledge management and the Web from the perspective of lessons learned from software development over the last two decades. Provides lightning fast mind-mapping, creative zettelkasten note taking, indexing, publishing, and sharing with the KEG community of your choosing in any number of ways. If you love the command line, and need a CLI mind-mapping tool that works to produce GitHub compatible files and expands into full publications then you should really have a look.

* ðŸŒ³ **Go Helper Commands and Tasks**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/good>

  Building for multiple targets from `build.yaml` file.

* Fetch string data from common sources  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/get>

  This package allows developers to leave the decision about where to store important string data to the end user of their applications. Some users might be okay passing tokens on the command line, or from environment variables while others might require that to be stored in a file, or a remote file secured with ssh. The get package covers these use cases by defining a set of schemas that include just returning the first or last line of a file enabling comments in files as well as log-like last line lookups. Common places to store files (home, .config, .cache) are included. Helper functions cover the common cases of scp-ing large numbers of files in a single command, or capturing the output of a single ssh command.

* Easy Date/Time Formats with Duration Spans  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/dtime>

  This package makes date and time offsets and durations drop-dead simple to calculate and enter from the command line or just tapped with thumbs into a phone. Uses PEG to define it's grammar (and was the inspiration to create PEGN later).

* Easy Input-Output Test Specifications in YAML  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/tinout>

  Designed to make testing a large number of variations kept in a YAML file that also serve as documentation (inspired by the CommonMark specification and testing).

* Pure Go secure shell (SSH) functions  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/ssh>

  Collection of functions employing the `crypto/ssh` package with sensible defaults enabling pure Go secure shell remote command calls.

* **Buffered Rune Scanner**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/scan>

  A simple, highly performant buffered rune scanner; optimized for
  infinite lookahead/behind; designed with grammar creation in mind;
  optional trace logs to help debug complex scans

* **Functional Programming with Go Generics**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/fn>

  My own collection of map/filter/reduce/each-like things; great for
  rapid (replacing shell scripts) development; includes a terse `fn.A`
  functional array type, library of map functions (`mapf`), map
  transformations (`maps`), and UNIX filters (`filt`); (also see
  <https://github.com/samber/lo>

* **File and Directory Utilities**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/fs>

  Supplements the standard filesystem functions with simplifications and extras that make rapid application development slightly less annoying in Go; be sure to use `lockedfile` from <https://github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal>) for system-wide file locking. Includes extracting and caching `embed.FS` file systems. Includes transactional preservation. Includes multipart file
  marshaling.

* **Embed and Encapsulate Java JAR, Class, Java Files**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/java>

  Import and use Java directly into Go programs by embedding Java
  artifacts and extracting and caching them deterministically so that
  the only dependency is `java` on the system running the Go code. Make
  quick work of distributing Java applications with `go install`. Used
  to encapsulate the OpenAPITools generator.

* ðŸŒ³ **Java OpenAPI Generator Encapsulated in Go**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/openapi>

  This Bonzai branch includes the latest `openapi-generator-cli`
  embedded and cached within it along with an optional Dockerfile for
  building a container to work with OpenAPI 3.0 specifications and code
  and documentation generation.

* **JSON Done Right with Remote Source Marshaling**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/json>

  Fixes the very broken defaults in `encoding/json`; includes `AsJSON`
  interface; unmarshaling JSON directly from web via HTTP requests into
  any type that can be passed to `json.Unmarshal` by leveraging yaml.v3
  `inline` (learned from the Kind project)

* **Marshal Anything as YAML**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/yaml>

  A personal commitment to first marshal everything in YAML since
  yaml.v3 is so superior to anything available for JSON --- especially
  `yaml:",inline"`. I prefer to YAML all the config things and Protobuf
  all the performant data serialization things. JSON is unavoidable when
  consuming web APIs, however.

* **VT100 ANSI Terminal Utilities**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/term>

  VT100 ANSI terminal escapes; no wasteful function calls just to change
  colors or terminal state; interactive terminal detection; window size
  queries; read visible and hidden user input

* **Bash `select` for Generic Slices**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/choose>

  Includes sample fmt.Stringer implementation for different struct types.

* **Slug generator**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/slug>

  Best of breed slug generation encapsulating the very popular simplego/slug.

* **Converter Utility Functions**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/to>

  Transformations I find myself doing so much that they warrant their
  own `to` package module; string -> lines, etc.

* **Hybrid Data Structures with Generics**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/structs>

  I use this everywhere. Having proper data structures is main reason I
  maintain a [Bonzai command tree](https://github.com/rwxrob/z) instead
  of a bunch of shell scripts. `qstack` is usually better than Go slices
  for most applications; `tree` is perfect for making ASTs and domain
  specific language parsing combined with
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/scan>)

* ðŸŒ³ **Universal Unique Identifiers**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/uniq>

  The usual universal unique identifiers: `uuid`, `isosec`, `epoch`,
  `base32`, `hex`; includes high-level `pkg` library; essential for
  cobbling together flat-file data stores, etc.

* ðŸŒ³ **YAML to JSON Converter**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/y2j>

  YAML to JSON conversion without the unnecessary `encoding/json`
  escapes (see rwxrob/json above); includes `pkg` with high-level
  `Convert` function

* ðŸŒ³ **Popular YAML Query Utility**  
  <https://github.com/rwxrob/yq>

  This is a duplicate of the `yq` tool (with the same `yqlib`
  dependency); includes `pkg` with high-level `Evaluate` and
  `EvaluateToString` functions with reasonable defaults; can be called
  from other Bonzai commands; dropped Cobra dependency

## Other Awesome Stuff

* **`jq` without `jq` in Go code**  
  <https://github.com/thedevsaddam/gojsonq/v2>

* **`jq` in Pure Go**
  <https://github.com/itchyny/gojq/>

  This is used in the world-class, absolutely amazing `gh` GitHub
  command line utility (and is the basis for the `jq` Bonzai branch)

* **Tcell, Best Go Terminal Low-Level Library**  
  <https://github.com/gdamore/tcell>

  Pure-Go terminal "cell" (curses) library for text terminals; best in
  class at the moment

* **Tview, Best Go Terminal User Interface Library**  
  <https://github.com/rivo/tview>  
  <https://code.rocketnine.space/tslocum/cview>

  It's like having CSS in your terminal (but not); makes short work of
  terminal applications that need regularly used widgets, used by K9S
  and others; `cview`, a forked version, is also good

* **Lodash in Go**  
  <https://github.com/samber/lo>

  If you are into `lodash` (from Node, I never was) you can try this;
  good for getting Go 1.18 ideas; seven times faster than equivalents
  using Go reflection

* **Grab, Highly Concurrent Downloads with Status**  
  <https://github.com/cavaliercoder/grab>

  When you need really good download ability

* **Only Truly Safe Way to Write a File in Go**  
  <https://github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal>

  The internal libraries used by the `go` binary itself; home of
  `lockedfile` (proposed standard addition); *truly* safe writes to a
  file on all operating systems; (You're probably doing it wrong.
  Creating a "lock" file is never enough.)

* **Protobuf Performant Serialization**  
  <https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf>

  Best of breed way to turn a struct into a data stream or file and
  parse it (unmarshal) it back into a struct later; basis of gRPC and
  most Kubernetes communication; replaces JSON APIs for most things

* Glamour, Themed Markdown Rendering for Terminal  
  <https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour>

  This is the same used for `gh`.

* **modernc.org/sqlite**  
  <https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite>

  Package sqlite is a cgo-free port of SQLite. The 20% loss of performance is worth it for most people to have cross-compilation compatibility.

* **SQLX, the Missing SQL Package**  
  <https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx>

  Without this `database/sql` is remarkably painful to use.

## Learning Resources

There are a lot of bad Go learning resources out there. Most of them are
woefully out of date. Just be really careful. Nothing goes on this this
that isn't 100% relevant to modern Go 1.18+ and available for free
(although I encourage you to support them the best you can).

* **Go-Nuts USENET Newsgroup.**  
  <https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts>

  This is where the creators and Go project leaders are regularly
  answering questions and discussing the direction of the language. This
  resource is far better than Reddit and even the official Go Discord
  channel (which you can find from <https://go.dev>). Keep in mind that
  anything ever written here is permanently saved, forever. I prefer
  this because all submissions are moderated and people actually take a
  moment to consider what they write before posting toxic crap (unlike
  Reddit and Discord, etc.)

* **Beej's Guide to Network Programming**  
  <https://beej.us/guide/bgnet>

  The book is in C, but so much of Go programming overlaps with that
  domain --- especially with microservices --- that reading this book
  should be mandatory for Go developers (or any developer). It covers
  things like proper UNIX file system semaphores and other architectural
  design concerns that most people coming to coding from academia or
  otherwise just won't think about intuitively.

* **Why Go and Not Rust**  
  <https://kristoff.it/blog/why-go-and-not-rust>>

  This is a very stoic and objective look (not my personal writing
  style) at why Go is *the* language of enterprise and cloud-native
  computing and why it will *never* lose that position to anything else
  --- especially Rust. I'll confess to a, "well duh" thought a time or
  two while reading it, but a lot of beginners and veterans alike might
  need to read the very practical reason why Go is the best tool for
  *most* things and Rust is perhaps the best tool for a few isolated
  things, which is why the most significant software applications of the
  cloud and container era were all written in Go, not Rust and, by
  extension, why there are tons of jobs for Go and almost zero for Rust
  developers.

* **Protocol Buffers**  
  <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>

  Protobuf format is mandatory learning for any serious Go developer
  wanting to get into microservices or anything that communicates or
  caches with performance requirements.
